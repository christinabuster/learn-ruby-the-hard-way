# more practice with strings, formating sequences, and printing, building patterns and habits

#this is a string
puts "Mary had a little lamb."
# this is a string that uses formating sequences to inject the 
# string 'snow' into the entire string 
puts " its fleece was white as %s." % 'snow'
# this is a string
puts "and everywhere that mary went."
# create a string . and print is 10 times
puts "." * 10 # what'd that do?

# create variables for letters to spell cheeseburger 
end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"

end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# use the print function to print each letter consecutivly so that it spells out the work cheeseburger
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6 
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
